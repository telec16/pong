# Analog pong

The pong game, all in analog and on your scope !

# Design explanation

TODO... The KiCAD files are well documented though.

# Build

## Score counter

I decided to build the score counter in free-form, since it has all these diodes, it would be huge on a regular PCB.

## Goal detector

The goal detector PCB is a tilable design: you need two PCBs to make one. It lowers PCB cost (divide by two) and uses a little less components.

More pictures to come, I guess.

## Oscillator

I have hand-drawn the oscillator board, and etched it at home. It looks nice, I think.

![Ramp and Pulse](https://github.com/telec16/pong/raw/master/pictures/ramp_pulse.png "It works well!")

The ball oscillator+phaser works well (pictures in coming). But the ramp/pulse oscillator have to put 1W in a transistor, oops... Bad design, I need to change that...
